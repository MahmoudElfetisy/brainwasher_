<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h3>H1 | Font Name | 36px</h3>
<br>

<h2>This is my font selection. I chose Permanent Marker for the main headings to create a sense of natural friendliness and fun, and the geometric Montserrat typeface to give a more stable feel to the information layer.</h2>
<h3>H2 | Montserrat,300 | 14px</h3>
<br>

<p>The Montserrat typeface was inspired by the old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires. It was designed by Julieta Ulanovsky, in an attempt to rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<h3>P | Montserrat,100 | 14px</h3>
